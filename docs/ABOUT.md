## Challenge

### Problem

Malindi's cultural heritage is at risk due to modernization, urbanization, and the lack of a centralized platform to preserve, document, and showcase its rich history and traditions.

### Root Causes

Rapid development, changing demographics, and insufficient efforts in documenting and passing down cultural knowledge to future generations contribute to the erosion of Malindi's cultural identity.

## What It Will Solve:

The platform seeks to address the imminent loss of Malindi's cultural heritage by leveraging digital tools to:

- **Preserve:**
  - Create a comprehensive digital archive of cultural artifacts, historical events, and traditional practices.
- **Promote:**
  - Showcase the unique cultural aspects of Malindi through engaging multimedia content, virtual tours, and interactive features.
- **Foster Community Engagement:**
  - Encourage active participation from residents, students, and cultural enthusiasts in the documentation and preservation process.

## What It Will Not Solve:

While the project is dedicated to cultural heritage preservation, it acknowledges its limitations:

- **Environmental Challenges:**
  - The project will not directly address broader environmental issues affecting Malindi.
- **Economic Challenges:**
  - Economic disparities and development challenges fall outside the project's scope.

## Target Users:

The platform is designed to cater to a diverse audience, including:

- **Residents:**
  - Engage with and contribute to the preservation of their cultural heritage.
- **Tourists:**
  - Explore Malindi's cultural richness and history during their visit.
- **Students:**
  - Access a valuable educational resource for learning about Malindi's heritage.
- **Cultural Enthusiasts:**
  - Contribute insights, stories, and experiences to enrich the platform.

## User Involvement:

Residents and cultural enthusiasts will be encouraged to actively participate in content creation, ensuring the platform reflects the dynamic and living nature of Malindi's cultural heritage.

## Risks

### Technical Risks

Potential challenges in integrating virtual reality and e-commerce features; safeguards include thorough testing and incremental development.

### Non-Technical Risks

Community resistance or lack of interest; strategies include community involvement from the early stages and continuous feedback loops.

## Infrastructure

### Branching and Merging

GitHub Flow will be utilized for branching and merging, ensuring a streamlined collaborative development process.

### Deployment Strategy

Continuous deployment with automated testing and staging environments to catch potential issues before production.

### Data Population

Initial data population will involve collaboration with local institutions and community input, followed by user-generated content over time.

### Testing Tools

Automated testing using Pytest and Jest, with continuous integration for efficient error detection.

## Existing Solutions

### Similar products

Cultural heritage platforms, virtual museum apps.

### Similarities and Differences

Our platform focuses specifically on Malindi's cultural heritage, offering language preservation, and e-commerce features, which differentiate it from general cultural platforms.

### Reimplementation Decision

While existing solutions address broader cultural heritage, our reimplementation emphasizes the unique aspects of Malindi's diverse traditions, ensuring cultural specificity and a more immersive user experience.
